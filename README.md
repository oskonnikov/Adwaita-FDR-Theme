# Adwaita-FDR-Theme
Classic Adwaita theme is very good but seems old. I tried to fresh it up by removing unnecessary details.
Red accent color is just beginning.
if you like this theme, I will continue its development.

Based on GTK Adwaita.
Without gradients, used darker background (#151515) and bright red accent (#E60012)
Inspired by ThinkPad red dot color.
To install this theme unpack archive to your ~/.themes folder or press Install on Appearance window and choose this file.
